For future development, we plan to implement a chatbot that can interact with users to provide personalized predictions and insights about Alzheimer's disease risk based on user inputs. The chatbot will guide users through a series of questions related to their health, lifestyle, and family history, and will use the trained model to provide predictions in real-time.
