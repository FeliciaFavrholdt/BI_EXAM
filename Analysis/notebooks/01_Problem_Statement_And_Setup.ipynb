    "Alzheimer’s is a progressive condition that affects memory/thinking, and early detection can make a big difference in how the disease is managed, and patients quality of life. In this project, we want to explore how Business Intelligence (BI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be used to analyze real patient data, including age, gender, health conditions, and lifestyle habits like diet and exercise. By finding patterns in the data, we hope to build a smart system that can support earlier diagnosis, so doctors can take action sooner and improve patient outcomes."

    "\n",
    "The main goal of this project is to build a simple and practical system that can help doctors and healthcare-staff assess a patient’s risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. We want to do this by using Business Intelligence (BI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques on real patient data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Our goals include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Creating a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of an Alzheimer’s diagnosis.\n",
    "- Identifying which features—such as age, gender, health conditions, and lifestyle habits are most strongly linked to Alzheimer’s risk.\n",
    "- Designing an interactive dashboard that presents predictions and feature insights in a clear, user-friendly way for clinical use\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we aim to uncover the following patterns in the dataset:\n",
    "- **H1:** Patients over the age of 75 are more likely to be diagnosed with Alzheimer’s than younger individuals\n",
    "- **H2:** Lower MMSE (Mini-Mental State Exam) scores and higher CDR (Clinical Dementia Rating) scores are strong indicators of Alzheimer’s diagnosis\n",
    "- H3: Patients who report higher physical activity and better diet quality show lower risk levels for Alzheimer’s disease"

    "## Project Scope and Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "This project explores how Business Intelligence (BI) and machine learning can help detect Alzheimer’s disease at an early stage.  \n",
    "We use a real dataset with over 2,000 patients, including details like age, gender, health conditions, and lifestyle habits.  \n",
    "By analyzing this data, we aim to build a system that helps doctors identify who may be at risk before symptoms become severe.  \n",
    "The goal is to support faster and more informed decisions in healthcare using data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use real patient data to train a model that can predict Alzheimer’s risk.\n",
    "- Identify which features (age, diet, exercise, test scores) are most important for prediction.\n",
    "- Clean and prepare the data using BI methods to make it ready for analysis.\n",
    "- Build an interactive dashboard that presents predictions clearly for healthcare staff.\n",
    "- Document the full process in Jupyter Notebooks and publish the project on GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of the project, we aim to deliver:\n",
    "- A clean, structured dataset ready for analysis.\n",
    "- A trained machine learning model for Alzheimer’s risk prediction.\n",
    "- Saved visualizations and model files for future use.\n",
    "- A simple Streamlit web app to explore predictions and insights.\n",
    "- Clear documentation of the problem, the steps taken, and what we learned.\n",
    "- A complete project repository shared on GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Impact and Beneficiaries\n",
    "\n",
    "This project supports healthcare professionals, such as doctors and nurses, in detecting Alzheimer’s earlier and planning better care.  \n",
    "It improves decision-making, saves time, and helps patients get support sooner.  \n",
    "The dashboard could be especially useful in clinics, hospitals, or memory care units working with elderly patients or those showing early signs of cognitive decline."

    "\n",
    "**1. Which challenge would you like to address?**  \n",
    "We want to solve the challenge of detecting Alzheimer’s disease early by analyzing patient data such as age, gender, health history, and lifestyle habits. Our goal is to use data to find patterns that show who might be at higher risk, so healthcare professionals can act sooner and provide the right care.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**2. Why is this challenge an important or interesting research goal?**  \n",
    "Alzheimer’s is a serious illness that affects memory and daily life, and it worsens over time. Early detection is key, but it’s not always easy. If we can use data to spot early warning signs, doctors can respond faster, which can help improve quality of life and slow the progression of the disease.    \n",
    "\n",
    "**3. What is the expected solution your project would provide?**  \n",
    "We plan to build a machine learning model that uses real patient data to predict a person’s risk of Alzheimer’s. The results will be shown in a simple, visual dashboard that helps doctors and nurses quickly understand the predictions and which factors matter most.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**4. What would be the positive impact of the solution, and which category of users could benefit from it?**  \n",
    "Our solution can support doctors, nurses, and caregivers by giving them better tools to detect Alzheimer’s earlier. It could be used in clinics, hospitals, or memory care units to make smarter decisions, save time, and improve care for patients who need it most."
